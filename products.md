# Controller housings
The main way for other people to interact with your OeM system, and a quick visual way too identify a unit.

These will typicall show your serial number, what kind of being you are and a battery indicator if you have a battery.

All our products (but not our scripts) are of course copyable and moddable to your (synthetic) hearts content.

## CH-One

## CH-One Mini
![Product image](/Obedientiae-ex-Machina-Docs/images/products/CH_One_Mini_2.png)

Shows your serial number, battery charge, the color reflects your the color in your controller.

The battery holder automatically hides if you don't have a battery, but this behaviour can be configured via a menu (Devices-\>CH One Mini-\>Show hide).
Likewise, it'll also position the battery (if you got one), this behaviour can also be configured via that menu (Devices-\>CH One Mini-\>Battery position).

# Battery

Our products are focused on configurabillity, and our batteries are no exception.

If you don't want to use a battery (or can't afford it yet!) well, you don't need to!

If you like the fun of it but don't want to charge too frequently, you can set the duration to a day or two.

If you want to be reminded that you are a machine, helpless and dependent, set the duration to an hour, and configure the controller to *require* a battery, you'll be reminded all right~

All configurations of these can be done via our deep configuration stations, which are rezzed in our store on the second level (underneath the banner "Config Stations")

## Basic Battery (Catalytic Fusion Battery 98)
