# Controller housings
Controller Housings are the most convenient and quick way for you (or friends, or anybody) to interact with your unit’s Controller system. It offers a quick, foolproof way to identify a unit by displaying its serial number and a way to identify the unit’s type. For units that utilize electricity, this also offers a battery charge indicator.

All of our Wearable and Equippable products are able to be Copied and Modified to your heart’s desire, however our Scripts are offered with Copy permissions only.

# Battery

## Basic Battery (Catalytic Fusion Battery 98)

We’ve put our main focus towards the user’s ability to configure their products as they wish, and our batteries are no exception. 

If you do not wish to use a battery, or cannot afford to purchase one, you are under no obligation to do so.

If in possession of a battery, you are able to configure its electrical capacity to last for a day or two for general use. However, if you wish to remind your unit that they depend on someone greater than themselves, you may set the capacity to an hour per battery and configure the controller to require a battery for continued use… And set a timer for how long your unit lasts before begging for milliampere scraps.

(All configuration of these battery features can be tweaked at our deep configuration stations, which are rezzed out in our inworld store’s second level. They are located underneath the banner that reads, ‘Config Stations.’)

Requires a Controller to use.
