## Welcome to Obedientia ex Machina

Obedientia ex Machina is a new system for all your robot RP and Control needs in Second Life.
We are located at the Synthetic Union and you can find us at [this location](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/GEL%20Community%2042/167/178/62).

We specialize in flexibility and extensibillity, with a wide set of features to enhance roleplay, or to completely lock down your property.

- A fast, stable, base.<br />
  We worked hard to make a stable system for our product, menus that won't crash your controller when multiple people access it, the option to edit your items and still keep them running (within limits).
- Subsystem menu, for RLV restrictions.<br />
  See [the menu systems for a full overview](./menu_system). If you're creative, the raw [RLV command](./notecard_scripting) in the notecards can do even more.
- Voice control and renaming; also modulation (modification) both via notecards and via scripts
- Follow system<br />
  Freeze your unit in place except to follow you around. Take them any where
- Notecard programming<br />
  For both RP, and RLV features. RP configure the unit's behaviour, make this add restrictions, what ever you can think off.
- Lightbus compatibility<br />
  Accesorizing is important, we know this, and you don't want to throw away your old things.<br />
  Wherever possible we interoperate with existing standards to keep your things working.
- Advanced owner system with permissions<br />
  Several different roles, guest access, blacklist, and of course, the option to lock the wearer completely out.
- Devices!<br />
  You are what you wear. Right now we only have Controller Panels and batteries. Batteries are not mandatory by default, but there are configuration stations that can change that.
- No rebuying what you already have.<br />
  You want a battery with different charge level? Well, just visit our handy hardware configuration station and set how long your battery lasts<br />
  You want a new housing because it looks pretty? Just buy the new housing, no need to buy an expensive new controller as well!<br />
