# Main Menu

This is the menu that opens up when the  controller is first accessed

## Subsystems Menu

Menu that controls the unit's subsystems through RLV. If the tick(‚úî) is next to the subsystem it means it is currently allowed, an ‚ùå means it is restricted.

### Video input
Allows/denies the unit to see ( vision restrictions might depend on the viewer you are using )

### Audio Input
Allows/denies the unit to hear chat and emotes. ((not xure if this automatically activated input filtering for emotes, would have to check. Doesn't clear the chat inside the emptes))**TODO**

### Radar
Allows/denies the unit to see the radar, to see who is nearby ( doesn't restrict it from checking minimap)

### Facial Recognition
Allows/denies the unit to recognize those around them ( see their names and  nametags )

### Geolocation
Allows/denies the unit to see their current position in world ( blocks map and location )

### Mind
Allows/denies the unit to chat. Currently similar to setting the volume to mute, but in the future it will have more uses **TODO**
one of it's uses is that the unit can't control the speakers in them, but other external commands might be able to. ((should probably be a fifth level volume...?))

### Volume Level
Has four levels:
Mute(üîà): doesn't allow chat.
Whisper(üîâ): Only allows whisper
No shout(üîá): Allows normal and whisper, but no shouting.
Normal(üîä): No restriction applied.

### Movement...
Submenu inside subsystems. Controls the Unit's abilities to move in the world.

#### Jetpack
Allows/denies the unit to Fly ()

#### Teleport
Has three levels.
No teleport: Doesn't allow any teleport
Secured teleport(üîí): The unit can't use the teleport, but others can teleport it
Teleport allowed:

#### Movement
Has three levels:
No movement: freezes the unit's motors, which doesn't mean they can't still use other methods of movement such as teleporting.
Secured Movement(üîí): takes away the control from the unit, but if there are external commands to move ( such as follow) the unit motors will answer to them
Slow Movement(‚ñ∂): Allows the unit only to walk, no running
Normal Movement(‚è©): Unit is able to walk and run normally

### LoRa Comms.
submenu that controls long range communications 

#### Start Comms.
Allows/denies the unit to start long range communications ( Instant messages)

#### Comms

Send(‚§¥Ô∏è): Only allows sending
Normal: allows both sending and receiving

#### Email

## IO Menu

### Out. Filters
Not implemented **TODO**

### In. Filters 
Not implemented **TODO**

### Out. release
Allows/denies the unit to release their output ( allows them to use the command !release to free their voice from the controller )

### Release input./ Filter input
(( currently blocks chat and emotes, but I am guessign the difference is that the chat is not completely blocked, but simply filtered))


## Administration

### Access

#### User list
Lists of users with a role inside the unit's controller. You can click on them to modify their role or to remove them. You can also add new users to the controller, in which case the default role will be "user"

#### Manage Roles
**TODO**

#### Blacklist
List blacklisted avatars, if you click on them you can change their role or remove them from the blacklist

#### Public Access
**TODO**

#### Self Access

Toggles self access, so the unit can't access it's own controller. 

#### Bolts
Toggles the bolt status between three modes:
on: Bolts are always on: this will lock the controller to the unit
off: Bolts will be unlocked: this will allow the removal of the controller at all times.
powered: Bolts will depend on the unit power status: if the power is off ( the unit is turned off) the bolts will be off. If the unit is on, the bolts will be on. 

### Personalization

#### Name
